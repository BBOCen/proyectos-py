<h1 align="center">📂 My Python Projects 📂</h1> 
<p align="center"> This collection of Python projects includes various interactive and useful applications, mostly developed using object-oriented programming (OOP), with practical functionalities such as file handling and user interaction. </p>

<h2>🚀 Main Features of My Projects</h2> 

<h3>📋 Task Organizer</h3> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>OOP and Persistence:</strong> Allows managing tasks using classes and objects. Data is saved in a file using <code>pickle</code>, which enables retrieving information between sessions.</li> 
  <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> The user can add, delete, and list pending tasks.</li> 
</ul> 

<h3>🎲 Number Guessing Game</h3> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>Interactive game:</strong> A game where the user must guess a random number generated by the program. It doesn’t use OOP but provides an entertaining guessing experience.</li> 
</ul> 

<h3>🧾 Invoicing</h3> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>OOP for invoice management:</strong> Allows creating and managing invoices for products using classes to represent the details of each invoice.</li> 
  <li><strong>User interaction:</strong> The user can enter products and quantities, generating a summary with the total.</li> 
</ul> 

<h3>📚 Library</h3> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>OOP for book management:</strong> Organizes and manages a library, where the user can add and remove books and loans using an object-oriented system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌐 How to Run These Projects</h2>
<p>Each of these projects can be run locally by simply downloading the code and executing it with Python. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for each to work properly.</p>

Note: the code is in Spanish.
